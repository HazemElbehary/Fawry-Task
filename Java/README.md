# Fawry Java Version

This folder contains a Java port of the original C# Fawry project.

## Structure
- All classes and interfaces from the C# version have been converted to Java.
- C# features like properties, LINQ, and DateTime have been adapted to Java equivalents.
- The entry point is `Program.java`.

## How to Run
1. Compile all `.java` files:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   java Program
   ```

## Notes
- The code uses only standard Java libraries.
- The logic and structure closely follow the original C# implementation.
